***Build Cerberus Content Mangement System by scratch-copy from source to eliminate any possiblity of malware carrying onto your server***

It's possbile for any file of any kind to be injected / infected by an undetectable Remote Access Trojan that would remotely connect to a RAT / BOT Server. Some of these
trojans are completely undetectable even to Linux Operating Systems, FreeBSD Operating Systems, Microsoft Windows Operating Systems, Android Operating Systems, Apple Operating Systems
and just about all malware scanners no matter how current the malware database is. Trojans like these can be hooked / injected into any kind of file whether it be a document,
audio file, image file or video file. It doesn't matter. Domestic and Foreign State Sponsored malware and just about ever other type of advanced malware is known to infect commercial
products and commercial hardware firmware itself to survive the reinstallation of the operating systems. This applies to everything on GitHub and everywhere else on the Internet as well.

It doesn't matter how good your security is. It doesn't matter how good your hardware security or security policies are. 

To eliminate any possibility of this you must build CerberusCMS from scratch-copy from the official GitHub. Every file would need to be duplicated into an
exact copy without actually using the same files from the official GitHub. You manually take the source code from the GitHub files on the web page
and then reproduce them on the hard drive without actually downloading them to the hard drive.

First off, each hardware component on the Web Server would need to be flashed with original OEM firmware that is the most up-to-date release.
Then an operating system would need to be installed and thoroughly configured and secured. After this use the terminal to install, configure and then security harden
the LAMP / WAMP / AAMP / FAMP / GAMP or other kind of server software and then do a manual scratch-copy build of the latest version of CerberusCMS.
Once after this is finished you can setup a security hardened web application firewall box. This will eliminate any possibly of any Remote Access Trojans or any other kind of malware 
infecting any files at all and should make the entire web server really extra difficult to hack remotely.

I wrote some C++ software from scratch that can be copied from source and then compiled in the terminal with GCC. This application then grabs the organized directory structure
from the official CerberusCMS GitHub and then it copies all of the source code from each of the files and then builds the entire system from scratch without actually downloading
any of the files from the GitHub in any method at all.

This makes it impossible for any malware to be carried over into an installation of CerberusCMS. The theme however would need to be made from scratch by you.
