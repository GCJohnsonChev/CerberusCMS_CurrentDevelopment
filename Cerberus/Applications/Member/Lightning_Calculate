The author is 100% self-taught and is privately researched.

<B>My research and collection</B> of what I like to call <B>\"Lightning Mental Mathematical Algorithms\"</B>, Lightning Mental Mathematical Tables and Lightning Mental Mathematical Proceedures began in ~2006 and 2007 at the age of 20 and 21 and as of 2023 I know and have detailed ~183 Lightning Mental Mathematical Algorithms that are apparently mostly or completely unknown to the rest of the world. How do I know these things are unknown to the rest of the world ? Becuase none of them exist in any books searchable on the Internet and no Mathematics Professor that I have talked to yet knew what I was talking about. Why don't they know about it ? Because they weren't shown or taught or they haven't figured it out for themselves yet.
From the years 2000 to present-day it seems that a new interest in this kind of Mathematics has sparked. I have seen several videos on the Internet where people are either fraudulently attempting these things or are using some kind of Mathematics Table. I decided to write this Web Application, Free Book and other resources and give it out to the public for free so as to demystify some of it as well as to show everyone who the fraudsters are since they have already put their videos on the Internet or have been recorded and have thus proved themselves as frauds and liars to everyone who has seen them. At this point in time I can compete with the world's foremost <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculator\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The :: Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Lightning Mental Calculator ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Lightning Mental Calculators</A> who are already known.

<B>This Application Module</B><BR>
This digital Application Module is meant for the <B>\"Lightning Mental Calculating\" community</B>. If you are a <B>Natural Lightning Mental Calculator</B>
or otherwise known as a <B>Counter</B> then this Application Module can train your mind through repeating steps and procedures in a repetitive pattern. With this Application Module you
can train your mind to acquire a faster <B>Mental Computation Time</B> and a higher and then perfect <B>Mental Computation Accuracy</B>. This digital Application Module generates
completely random numbers. None of the numbers ever repeat at all and none of the randomly generated numbers have any pattern. Just about every other Application out there including the Memoriad Software uses repeating numbers and a lot of zeros and that is considered fraudulent because it makes it easy.<BR><BR>

All of the digital Applications that are available on <A HREF=\"https://www.Apple.com/app-store\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Application Market For :: Apple iOS ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Apple's iOS &trade; &reg; Application Market</A>, <A HREF=\"https://Play.Google.com/store/apps\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Application Market For :: Google Android ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Google's Android &trade; &reg; Application Market</A> as well as <A HREF=\"http://www.Memoriad.com/index.asp?s=sayfalar&p=yazilimlar&lang=EN\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Application Market For :: Memoriad ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Memoriad &reg; Software</A> are fraudulent when it comes to this. Memoriad has been
noted by the <B>Lightning Calculating Community</B> as completely fraudulent. The Memoriad Software uses a lot of zeros, repeating numbers and easy numbers as well as fake and fraudulent scoring and flawed individual factors. In addition to the fraudulent software provided by Memoriad it would seem the Memoriad community itself is full of fraud.<BR><BR>

This Application Module is completely free of charge. The Programming Code was handwritten and is free to own and use. This Application Module comes with a hand written 100-Page book that was digitized into a High Definition Portable-Document-Format File. This book is also free to own and use. The usefulness
of this Application Module is good because it can be accessed freely through the Web Browser of a Mobile Device such as a Smart Phone. No installation of any software on a personal device is needed in order to use this Application Module. This Application Module is 100% Open Source Programming Code where even the specific instance of this Source Code can be seen from the Web Browser itself. This proves the Web Application does exactly what it says it does and all of the numbers generated are completely random.<BR><BR>

<B>Digital Record Keeping</B><BR>
If you have a Registered Member Account on this system: This Application Module will keep perfect track of your <B>Mental Computation Time</B> and your <B>Mental Computation Accuracy</B> with Statistics.

<B>What is \"Lightning Calculating\" and \"Lightning Mental Calculating\" ?</B><BR>
<A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculator\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Wikipedia Article Entry For :: Lightning Mental Calculating ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Lightning Mental Calculating</A> is the art of <A HREF=\"https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Computation\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Wikipedia Article Entry For :: Mental Computation ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Mentally Computing</A> long Arithmetic and mentally computing just about
any other kind of Mathematics at the <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Wikipedia Article Entry For :: Lightning\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">\"Speed of Lightning\"</A> or at least very quickly.<BR><BR>

<B>Lightning Mental Calculating</B> is also usually known as <B>\"Counting\"</B> by the people who already possess this natural ability. In the human population there
are those that are <B>\"Known\"</B> and recorded as having developed in part or in whole this universal ability, but just because there are lists of people that are known as having this ability that does not necessarily mean
that there are not others in the world who are not known as having developed this ability whether the ability is natural or acquired.<BR><BR>

<B>Lightning Mental Calculating Free Book</B>
This Web Application comes with a free <A HREF=\"./Theme/$_GLOBAL_SYSTEM_THEME_DIRECTORY/Image/Lightning_Calculate/[07-18-2023]_Lightning_Memoria_Mathematica_01.pdf\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The Portable-Document-Format File :: Lightning Memoria Mathematica ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">100 Page Hand Written Book on Lightning Mental Calculating that is called Lightning Memoria Mathematica</A>. Lightning Memoria Mathematica is the Latinized words meaning Lightning Memory Mathematics.<BR><BR>

<B>Lightning Mental Calculating Fraud</B><BR>
Just about every video and every resource on the publicly accessible Internet regarding <B>\"Lightning Mental Calculating\"</B> is fraudulent.<BR><BR>

Nearly all of the videos and all of the resources available on the publicly accessible Internet regarding <B>\"Lightning Mental Calculating\"</B> and <B>Mental Counting</B> at <B>\"Lightning Speed\"</B> are considered <B>\"Math Tricks\"</B> by the official <B>\"Lightning Mental Calculating\"</B>
community because none of the procedures shown in those videos and in those resources can be universally applied across all of Mathematics. Since the methodologies shown in those resources and in those videos cannot be applied or used across all of Mathematics that would mean that those methodologies are <B>\"Math Tricks\"</B> or are completely bogus especially because those methodologies only work for certain kinds of numbers and limited patterns.
The author of this Web Application has written an extensive Academic Article that lists every searchable digital book, digital news article, digital source and every searchable video regarding Lightning Mental Calculating that is accessible on the public Internet and then goes on to prove just about all of them as fraudulent. Scientists who have studied natural Lightning Human Calculators have concluded
that natural Lightning Mental Calculating abilities are actually acquired and developed around or after the age of 21. Just about all of the books on this subject that are available to the public are fraudulent and meant for the younger crowd.<BR><BR>

<B>Fake and Fraudulent Lightning Mental Calculators</B> will usually put on a display in front of others to convince them of their tricks.. but if one were to <B>\"Put them on the spot\"</B> in person and ask them to mentally
calculate and compute other and completely random mathematical operations in front of observers who are not invovled with either group the <B>Fraudulent Lightning Mental Calculator</B> will not be able to mentally calculate or compute what is asked of them.. because that supposed Lightning Human Calculator is a fraud.
<B>Natural Lightning Calculators</B> sometimes however have mixed brain chemistry and cannot perform the mental arithmetic operations asked of them at that exact moment in time due to that mixed brain chemistry or because of other factors such as <B>\"Stage Freight\"</B>. Memory Tables are also considered Lightning Mental Calculating Fraud because they can only
be applied to certain kinds of numbers and cannot be universally applied across all of Mathematics.<BR><BR>

<B>Development of Lightning Mental Calculating Ability</B><BR>
If you already possess some elements of the <B>Counting Ability</B> you can use this digital Application Module to develop that specific counting ability even further as well as acquire new ability and then fully develop that new ability.
You will find this digital Application Module very useful because there are no other Applications that exist that do what is available in this digital Application Module. When you begin to train the mind you will find that you do need
quickly generated random numbers and repetitive procedures <B>otherwise known as Mathematical Algorithms in order to further train the ability and make it permanent</B>. <A HREF=\"https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity\" TITLE=\":: Open & Dispaly The Wikipedia Article Entry For :: Synaptic Plasticity ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Human Brain Synaptic Plasticity</A> is mostly a falsity because once a skill and an ability is developed and automated it becomes a permanent part of the memory and the body because that specific development causes the brain to create new neuronal pathways that are permanent unless parts of the brain were damaged or physically removed aftwards. Human Brain neurons are very strong and are easily stimulated by the bodies movement through the world. In other words you can't learn this kind of mathematics by reading a book while isolated in a room unless you can control your imagination and location-memory.<BR><BR>

Through certain <A HREF=\"https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display The Wikipedia Article Entry For :: Meditation ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Meditation</A>, Practice and then through repetitive
procedures you will find a way to further develop and further strengthen your counting abilities. Once you have achieved a high level of <B>Mental Computation Accuracy</B> at <B>Lightning Mental Computation Speed</B> while looking at the numbers and the objects on the screen you will then begin to acquire the ability to <B>Mentally Compute</B> everything without any visual aid at all whatsoever.
<B>Mental Computation without visual aid</B> is mentally performing the mathematical operations without looking at anything and without looking at any numbers with your eyes. An example of that statement would be if someone held up a calculator and asked you to mentally multiply a random set of numbers such as 362 * 824. With practice you can mentally compute this in 30 seconds or less. You become faster as you practice this and as you practice and
develop your ability you then acquire new ability and the ability to retain values and mentally calculate higher numbers.<BR><BR>

<B>Who Was Taught Lightning Mental Calculating and Eidetic, Photographic Memory Techniques Historically and Present-Day ?</B><BR>
* Western European Royalty<BR>
* Western European Military Officers<BR>
* U.S. Presidents and Politicians<BR>
* Rich Film Actors<BR>
* Rich Corporate Executive Officers and Rich Merchants<BR>
* Academics<BR><BR>

<B>Where Do Some of These Human Memory Techniques Come From ?</B><BR>
<A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos\" TITLE=\":: Digitized WoodCut of Simonides of Ceos Holding His Book -- Digitized WoodCut From The Nuremberg Chronicles or Liber Chronicarum ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"><IMG SRC=\"./Theme/$_GLOBAL_SYSTEM_THEME_DIRECTORY/Image/Lightning_Calculate/SimonidesofCeos.png\" CLASS=\"AMAForumTMAuthor\" TITLE=\":: Digitized WoodCut of Simonides of Ceos Holding His Book -- Digitized WoodCut From The Nuremberg Chronicles or Liber Chronicarum ::\"></IMG></A>
The author of this web application has written an extensively thorough and academic book of ~2,000 pages that has chapters within it that completely detail the origins of the Methods of Loci to Simonides of Ceos, Cicero and others during and before the time of Simonides of Ceos. Bacchylides and the earlier Aristotle apparently knew the location memory techniques as some elements of them are shown in their attributed works. The location memory techniques were found again in preserved works by raiding Knights of the Roman Catholic Church
in the <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades\" TITLE=\":: Open and Display :: The Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Catholic Crusades ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Catholic Crusades</A> from the years 1100 onward and in the Roman Catholic raiding of the Eastern Orthodox territories especially in the raiding and <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Constantinople\" TITLE=\":: Open and Display :: The Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: The Raiding and Sacking of Constantinople ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Sacking of the Historical City of Contantinople in Modern Day Istanbul, Turkey</A> where they took much the knowledge back to Western Europe and it passed down through the ages to the French and Italian Rennaisance from approximately 1300 to 1600 and some of the methods were made public during this time by oratores.<BR><BR>

The city of Constantinople historically was fought over by Western European Catholics and <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The :: Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Eastern Orthodox Church ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Eastern Orthodox Greeks</A> for over a <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The :: Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Millenium ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">millenia</A> from the years of ~400 A.D. to present-day due to the relics of the Churches. Every time each side won over the Muslims and the Jews the city transferred ownership to either Western European Catholics or the Eastern Orthodox Christians. The location memory techniques disappeared into scarcity and the Western European Roman Catholic Church is known to have preserved much of the location memory techniques as they are seen
in the writings from 1100 to 1700. The Eastern Church which is also known as the Eastern Orthodox Church of the Greek and Eastern Rites call some of the techniques Greek Lightning.<BR><BR>

Simonides of Ceos, Greece was known to have memorized every name and every face living in a Greek City within a few weeks of meeting them all in person. Supposedly Simonides memorized the names and faces of more than 1,500 people and then he recited each of their names in front of them more than a Greek month later. Everyone in the city thought that Simonides of Ceos was a <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigod\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The :: Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Demi-God ::\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Demi-God</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>The Mutated Legend of Simonides of Ceos</B><BR>
Legend has it that Simonides himself was approached by Zeus and an unnamed female deity to be given the <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory\" TITLE=\":: Open & Display :: The :: Wikipedia Article Entry :: For :: Eidetic Memory, Photographic Memory and Total Recall\" TARGET=\"_NEW\">Methods of Loci and Total Recall</A>. Early documents show that when Simonides taught some of this to the local politicians and officials who after seeing Simonides
godly mental faculties demanded to know how he had amassed a perfect memory of everything in the city and all of the people’s names and faces.. they were thereafter destroyed by Zeus for their corruption while seated within a banquet hall seated also by Simonides himself who was spared.
The banquet hall was destroyed by a sudden earthquake where parts of the building came crashing down crushing and killing all of the people who were sitting around the tables. Simonides was later called upon by the local authorities to identify the bodies of the people who died at the tables because their bodies were disfigured and not identifiable.<BR><BR>

The local authorities were amazed to see that Simonides identified them all based on where they were seated around the tables because he remembered where each person was seated. Simonides began his travels through Greece teaching to academics and others what he supposedly learned from Zeus himself. Rumor
spread around parts of Greece and Rome that there was a man gifted by the Gods who could memorize anything including entire books word for word, histories, thousands of citizen’s names and faces in a city. A man
who mastered Mathematics, Poetry, History and several other academic subjects.<BR><BR>

<B>Other Techniques</B><BR>
Writings found in some historical documents show that Scandinavians and Germans identified and developed Non-Mnemonic Memory Techniques known as...<BR><BR>

<B>Quick Example of Counting</B><BR>
One quick and simple example of <B>\"Counting at Lightning Speed\"</B> would be mentally adding together the random numbers 9256 + 8431 in around or less than 1 second.<BR>
* Firstly: You would mentally add together the 9,000 + 8,000 and this becomes the sum: 17,000<BR>
* Secondly: You would then add together the 200 + 400 and this becomes the sum: 600, after that you would then add that sum to the previous sum and this becomes the sum 17,600<BR>
* Thirdly: You would then add togther the 50 + 30 and this becomes the sum: 80, after that you would then add that sum to the previous sum which was: 17,600 and this becomes the sum: 17,680<BR>
* Finally and Lastly: You would then add together the 6 + 1 and this becomes the sum: 7, so now add the 7 to the 17,680 and this now becomes 17,687<BR><BR>

You would add from left to right without writing anything down. Simply by looking at the screen you would know that 9256 + 8431 is 17,687 within less than or around 1 second. The more you practice this proceedure the faster you get
at it and this mental proceedure becomes a new mental ability. This mental ability now becomes permanent after you do it like this over and over again.<BR><BR>

Another quick example of <B>Counting at Lightning Speed</B> would be mentally multiplying the numbers 62 * 84 in 0 to 5 seconds.<BR><BR>

<B>Quick Example of Lightning Mental Multiplication Steps</B><BR>
* Step #1: 60 * 80 = 4800<BR>
* Step #2: 60 * 04 = 240<BR>
* Step #3: 02 * 80 = 160<BR>
* Step #4: 02 * 04 = 8<BR>
* 4,800 + 240 + 160 + 8 = 5,208<BR><BR>

<B>Group A: 62</B><BR>
* A1 Within Group A: 62<BR>
* A2 Within Group A: 60<BR>
* A3 Within Group A: 02<BR><BR>

<B>Group B: 84</B><BR>
* B1 Within Group B: 84<BR>
* B2 Within Group B: 80<BR>
* B3 Within Group B: 04<BR><BR>

<B>Group C: 5,208</B><BR>
C1 Within Group C: 4800<BR>
C2 Within Group C: 240<BR>
C3 Within Group C: 160<BR>
C4 Within Group C: 8<BR><BR>

<B>Logical In-Order Algebraic Pattern and Algorithm</B><BR>
* A2 * B2 = C1, 4800<BR>
* A2 * B3 = C2, 240<BR>
* A3 * B2 = C3, 160<BR>
* A3 * B3 = C4, 8<BR>
* C1 + C2 = 5,040<BR>
* C2 + C3 = 5,200<BR>
* C3 + C4 = 5,208<BR><BR>

In between the four steps shown above this statement one would quickly add together:<BR>
* 4800 + 240 + 160 + 8<BR><BR>

to arrive at the sum 5,208 in 0 to 5 seconds. If one can accurately and quickly compute this by using the proceedure shown above this statement then one could be considered a Lightning Human Calculator. This mental feat can be attributed
to numerous historical and present-day Mathematicians such as Leonard Euler and others such as the world famous Rüdiger Gamm. Once after these proceedures are mastered the Lightning Human Calculator can then move on to <B>\"Higher Numbers\"</B> such as 381 * 925 or 4423 * 9272.<BR><BR>

<B>Fraudulent Mental Calculating Competitions, Fraudulent Mental Calculating Software and Fraudulent Mental Calculating World Records</B><BR>
There are numerous fraudulent \"World Records\" on Lightning Mental Calculating.<BR>
* Firstly: there exist a few organizations who allow for digital competitions between supposed Lightning Human Calculators. Lightning Mental Calculating Digital Competition Scores can be completely <B>\"thrown under the bus\"</B> and rejected instantly because no digital competition scores can ever be trusted as accurate due to the possibility of cheating.<BR>
* Secondly: Most software for Lightning Mental Calculating cannot be trusted as accurate because most of the software is flawed and allows for cheating due to non-random and repeating numbers as well as numbers with too many zeros in a pattern that allow for cheating. Only a one on one competition in person with observers who are not involved with either person or any group where each competitor mentally performs all of the requested calculations without the assistance of a computer and without any visual aid at all whatsoever can be trusted as accurate. Observers could
be Mathematical Scientists, Mathematics Professors, other Lightning Mental Calculators and general non-associated public people.<BR>
* Thirdly: Most of the publicly accessible organizations for this use non-standard terminology for things that exist within the Lightning Mental Calculating scenario.<BR><BR>

<B>What Is The Difference Between Speed Mental Mathematics and Lightning Mental Mathematics ?</B><BR>
<B>Speed Mental Mathematics and Speed Mental Arithmetic</B> is mentally performing the Arithemtic and Mathematics Operations in a length of time that is not considered <B>Lightning Mental Mathematics and Lightning Mental Arithmetic</B>. Lightning Mental Calculating is mentally calculating exponential numbers at the <B>\"Speed of Lightning\"</B> which is usually around 1.5 seconds depending on certain other factors.<BR><BR>

<B>The Anglicized Word Mathematics and Its Origins</B><BR>
The spoken and written word: Mathematics is the anglicized word from the latin word Mathematica which is a plural meaning word that indicates more than one object. Ultimately the word is a mutation across several world languages meaning Universal or counting universally.<BR><BR>

<B>What Will I Gain From This and What Can I Do With It ?</B><BR>
Once after each system is mastered you will have mastered all of known Mathematics because all of known Mathematics is based on the simple concepts of Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication whether the numbers are whole and perfect positive and negative numbers or the numbers are fractions of whole and perfect positive and negative numbers. All modern Mathematical Expressions, Statements and Equations are easily solved like this because all of it is based on whole and perfect positive and negative numbers or fractions of perfect positive and negative numbers. Just about every modernly used mathematical notation symbol was devised or attached to a special value or concept around or after 1500 Anno Domini or Common Era and the idea of Common Era is actually a very recently introduced system of measuring time. All of the known Mathematical Expressions, Statements, Equations and more can easily be solved part by part and can be broken down to the actual whole or fractional numbers where one can then apply the order of P.E.M.D.A.S. to each set of numbers to then arrive at the correct answer no matter how complicated the Mathematical Expression, Statement or Equation is. Personally I have taken University-Level tests and scored nearly perfect or perfect.<BR><BR> 

<B>Training Course</B><BR>
The author of this digital Application Module has designed a training course for people that already possess the natural counting ability. This specific training course covers a span of 6 months of intensive mental training and internal meditation. The training course can be completed alone or with others. The author of this training system does not socially interact with anyone and the materials are completely public and completely free.
Once after this specific training course is completed the person who has undergone the training will possess a permanent set of mental abilities and will be capable of mentally calculating and mentally computing just about anything in mathematics with perfect or near perfect accuracy. This training course is meant for 21 years and older.<BR><BR>

<B>Human Organ Care</B><BR>
Every organ in the human body is important to care for. Each organ must be exercised and correctly cared for nutritionally. Most people have a strange thinking pattern where they only concentrate on one part of the body or one organ at a time when they exercise but the entire body is important. The entire body should be cared for simulatenously.<BR><BR>
