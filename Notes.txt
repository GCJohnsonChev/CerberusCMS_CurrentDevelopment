CerberusCMS will be updated and will be renamed to RunicCMS or something along those lines.

I will be renaming all of my software projects to take Germanic / Scandinavian / Frisian cultural names.

Runes and Germanic Gods and Goddesses. Cerberus is Greek Mythology but I am Scandinavian so it seems to
make more sense that all of my software projects names be named according to Scandinavian / Germanic / Frisian cultural
naming. I'll update this later. I will be forming a legit commercial software business.


Final version of CerberusCMS will be CerberusCMS — Version Number - 4 — Build Number - 0.8 — Edit Number - 1368 — Final

after this is finished the project will officially be renamed to Germanic / Scandivian cultural naming and graphics.
